OBJECTIVE : To detect anomalies in server requests

RESULT : Used covariance.EllipticEnvelope with contamination=0.03 to get 98.4% accuracy

LEARNT:
Greater the contamination factor, tighter the decision boundary
Making assumptions on underlying data to predict outliers
Novelty detection (no outliers in training data) vs outlier detectino (training data may contain anomalies)
