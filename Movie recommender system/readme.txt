OBJECTIVE: Predict movie ratings for viewers based on other ratings

RESULT: 
Script too slow to execute on single system as gradient descent has been implemented in script
Predicted rating of jth movie for ith user is x[i]*theta[j]^T

LEARNT:
Collaborative filtering algorithm
Implemented gradient descent in python
Leveraging numpy arrays for speed
